Calculating promotion type, new vs returning users, share of orders for each channel, mapping segments, and most importantly CLV.
One of key metrics for analyzing customers behavior is CLV.
CLV (Customer Lifetime Value) shows how much value (revenue) a customer can generate for business in his/her lifespan.
The basic formula for calculating CLV is:
CLV = APV * APF * ACL
APV = Average purchase value
APF = Average purchase frequency
ACL = Average customer lifespan
For Example: if customer A purchased a product 3 times with value of 100$ in 2 months and customer B purchased a product 4 times with value of 200$ in 4 months, CLV becomes: 3.5 * 150$ * 3
Our goal should be increase our loyal customers (customers with more lifespan and frequency) to grow our business. Accordingly, we can monitor this metric to see if we are doing so or not.
Because our Average purchase value is highly related to inflation (which was high in recent years), and also our marketing is not responsible for pricing, we skip APV and calculate APF * ACL for CLV
